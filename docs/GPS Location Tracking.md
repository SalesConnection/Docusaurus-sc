- **(Admin) How to restrict staff’s check-in location to the address stated?**<br>

  Check-in location will always be restricted with geofencing when a customer’s address is verified*. The maximum allowed check-in distance can be set @ Company Settings > Staff Settings > Check-in Distance Settings.<br>
  
  *Staff can still check in anywhere if the address is not verified or no address is selected for a job. (Note: all addresses imported from Excel initially are not verified.)<br><br>

- **How to verify the addresses of customers?**<br>

  On the customer’s details page or job edit page, go to the address field and click on the Red exclamation mark “!”  beside the address to verify it.<br>
  
  We recommend verifying the address of the customer on the first job you create under the customer.<br><br>
