## ðŸš¨ Why I unable to update app?
<aside>
(If yes to each, move on to the next scenario)
    
<br> <!-- Adding one line space -->

- **Is the version update available âœ… for the relevant mobile OS already? (Android/IOS)**<br>

  Make sure that the latest OS version is updated.<br><br>

- **If user clicks "OPEN PLAY STORE" but the Playstore cannot detect the new update (image below)**<br>

  </p>
  
  Request the user to:
  
  1. Close the Playstore.<br>
  2. Kill the app by swiping up.<br>
  3. Re-open the Playstore.<br>
  4. Search for "Sales Connection".<br>
  5. Update the Sales Connection app following the normal procedures ("Open" will become "Update").<br><br>

- **If the user's phone version is too old to support the update,**<br>

  Check what year his phone model is released (We do not support phone model older than 5 years).<br>
  
  Request the user to:
  
  1. Try to update his Android/IOS system to as newer version as possible.<br>
  2. Change to a new phone ðŸ“±.<br>
  3. Try to uninstall and install again the app to see whether the latest version of Sales Connection app will be used.<br><br>
