- **What can I do with the user list?**<br>

  You can check the list of all present users in your system, edit users‚Äô details (e.g. staff category, account type), deactivate user, and delete user.<br><br>
  
- **What is the green tick button inside the user list?**<br>

  The green tick button indicates that a user account is currently activated. Once you click on the button, the user will be deactivated (i.e. he can no longer log in to his account).<br>

  When a user is deactivated, the tick button will turn red, indicating that the user is currently deactivated.<br><br>

- **I saw some users with a red exclamation icon, what does it do?**<br>

  The red exclamation icon indicates that a user‚Äôs email address is not verified yet. Click on the red icon to send a verification email to the user.<br><br>
  
- **Some users have a blue color icon with a lock on it, what is this?**<br>

  The blue icon indicates that a user with ‚ÄúIMEI login check‚Äù enabled tried to log in to his account using another device.<br>
  Admins can click on the blue button to clear IMEI* so that the user can log in using a new device. <br>

  *Admins can also perform this action through the notification email received using the verified email address.<br><br>
