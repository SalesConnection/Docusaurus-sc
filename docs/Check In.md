<br> <!-- Adding one line space -->

- **Is the address correct ✅ ?**<br>

  Make sure that the address registered is used to check in.<br><br>

- **Is the staff near the site?**<br>

  ***Blue dot*** 🔵 indicates staff’s current location.<br>
  ***Red dot*** 🔴 indicates the site’s location 📌 (destination).<br><br>

- **Can the other technicians at the site check in?**<br>

  If **Yes**, check the internet connection.<br>
  If **No**, continue the step to troubleshoot.<br><br>

- **Is the internet connection/network strong enough?**<br>

  If the internet connection is weak - request user to connect to another network (e.g. colleague’s mobile hotspot 📱) and try again.<br><br>

- **Is the internet speed 🌐 fast enough?**<br>

  Request the user to download internet speed testing app:<br>
  **Android:** https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.zwanoo.android.speedtest<br>
  **IOS:** https://apps.apple.com/us/app/speedtest-by-ookla/id300704847<br><br>

- **Is the user’s phone GPS working?**<br>

  First, make sure GPS 🛰️ is turned on.<br>
  If the user is at the basement/lift/car park, request him to go somewhere outside, and try to check in from the job details page again.<br>
  If still cannot, ask him to turn off the GPS then turn it on again, and restart the Sales Connection app.<br><br>

- **Is the GPS location enabled 📍 ?**<br>

  Swipe down the status bar to enable Location. For certain phone models 📱, it may require the user to swipe up from the bottom instead to enable location.<br><br>

- **Is the permission enabled for the Sales Connection app to access their phone location 📍 ?**<br>

  Users must enable location permission for the app when they use it for the first time. If the permission was disabled, user will not be able to check in as image below.<br>

  Once done, close and re-open the app.<br><br>

- **Is the user’s phone consisting of fake GPS app?**<br>

  The user must disable the fake GPS 🛰️ to check in successfully.<br><br>
