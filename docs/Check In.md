    Request the user to download internet speed testing app:

- **Is the user’s phone GPS working?**
    
    First, make sure GPS 🛰️ is turned on.
    
    If the user is at the basement/lift/car park, request him to go somewhere outside, and try to check in from the job details page again.
    
    If still cannot, ask him to turn off the GPS then turn on again, and restart the Sales Connection app.
    
- **Is the GPS location enabled**📍**?**
    
    Swipe down the status bar to enable Location. For certain phone model📱, it may require the user to swipe up from bottom instead to enable location.
