(If yes to each, move on to the next scenario)
    
<br> <!-- Adding one line space -->

- **Is the photo update listed under "Pending Updates"**<br>

  1. On the top left corner of the mobile app, click on the 3 lines > Data Sync.<br>
  2. Check if the relevant job/project/digital form to be updated is in the list.<br>
  3. If No, go to the job details page and check if the photo is submitted.<br><br>

- **Is the user in offline mode?**<br>

  The job updates will be uploaded as soon as the user goes online. Ask him to open the app so that the updates will be uploaded when online.<br><br>

- **Is the internet connection & speed strong enough?**<br>

  1. If the internet connection is weak - request the user to connect to another network (e.g. colleagueâ€™s mobile hotspot) and try again.<br>
  2. Request the user to download an internet speed testing app:<br>
     - **Android:** https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.zwanoo.android.speedtest*<br>
     - **IOS:** https://apps.apple.com/us/app/speedtest-by-ookla/id300704847*<br><br>

- **If it is mobile, check settings if the user is allowed to upload from the gallery or not.**<br>
  Make sure permission is given to upload a photo.
  

- **If custom camera setting is on:**<br>

  Enable camera on = upload gallery photo from attachment.
