<br> <!-- Adding one line space -->

### If the whole app including the landing page is loading slowly<br><br>

**1. Is the user in offline mode?**<br>

&emsp; When offline, users can only view schedules and jobs (that are previously loaded). The other pages will not be accessible when offline.<br><br>
     
**2. Is the internet connection and speed strong enough?**<br>

&emsp; a. If the internet connection is weak - request the user to connect to another network (e.g. colleagueâ€™s mobile hotspot) and try again.<br><br>
&emsp; b. Request the user to download an internet speed testing app<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; - **Android:** https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.zwanoo.android.speedtest<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; - **IOS:** https://apps.apple.com/us/app/speedtest-by-ookla/id300704847<br><br>
    
**3. If No, go to the job details page and check if the photo is submitted.**<br><br><br>


### If only certain page or feature of the app is loading slowly<br>
