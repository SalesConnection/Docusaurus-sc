(If yes to each, move on to the next scenario)
    
<br> <!-- Adding one line space -->

- **If the whole app including the landing page is loading slowly"**<br>

  1. Is the user in offline mode?.<br>

     When offline, users can only view schedule and jobs (that are previously loaded). The other pages will not be accessible when offline.<br>
     
  2. Is the internet connection and speed strong enough?<br>

     a. If internet connection is weak - request user to connect to another network (e.g. colleagueâ€™s mobile hotspot) and try again.<br>
     b. Is the internet speed fast enough?<br>
        - Request the user to download internet speed testing app:
        - **Android:** https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.zwanoo.android.speedtest*<br>
        - **IOS:** https://apps.apple.com/us/app/speedtest-by-ookla/id300704847*<br>
    
  3. If No, go to the job details page and check if the photo is submitted.<br><br>

- **If only certain page or feature of the app is loading slowly**<br>
