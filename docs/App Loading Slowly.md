<br> <!-- Adding one line space -->

**If the whole app including the landing page is loading slowly"**<br>

1. Is the user in offline mode?.<br>

     When offline, users can only view schedules and jobs (that are previously loaded). The other pages will not be accessible when offline.<br>
     
2. Is the internet connection and speed strong enough?<br>

     a. If the internet connection is weak - request the user to connect to another network (e.g. colleagueâ€™s mobile hotspot) and try again.<br>
     b. Request the user to download an internet speed testing app?<br>

     &emsp; - **IOS:** https://apps.apple.com/us/app/speedtest-by-ookla/id300704847*<br>
    
3. If No, go to the job details page and check if the photo is submitted.<br><br>
