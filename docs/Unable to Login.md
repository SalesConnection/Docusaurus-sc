<br> <!-- Adding one line space -->

- **What error message appeared?**<br>

  - The user is not invited

    - Is the phone number entered correctly?
      
    - Check from the screenshot provided, does it match with the phone number registered for the user?
      
    - If it is a completely different phone number,
      
      - User is not added to the system.
      - User changed the phone number.

  - Response from server error
 
    - Request information from the user
      
      - Account details, consistent error or happen only once.
      - Anyone else from the company facing this issue?
        
    - If it happens only once, check if its a connection issue.
      
    - Check with the developer team
      
      - For a response from server error, most like our side has issues.

  - Connection Error
 
    - Is the internet connection and speed strong enough?
      
      - If the internet connection is weak - request user to connect to another network (e.g. colleague's mobile hotspot) and try again
      - Request the user to download internet speed testing app:
        
        - **Android:** https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.zwanoo.android.speedtest
        - **IOS:** https://apps.apple.com/us/app/speedtest-by-ookla/id300704847

- **Does not receive TAC through SMS?**<br>

  - Is the phone number entered accurately?

    - Make sure the phone number used is registered.

  - If a wrong number is entered and the user is blocked from requesting TAC code (24 hours),
 
    - Request the user to login using his email address and password.

  - If the user forgets his email or password, ask him to:
 
    - Click the green question mark button on the button right corner of the login page.
    - Fill in the phone number.
    - Contact Sales Connection support to obtain a code.
    - Enter the code and proceed to login.
