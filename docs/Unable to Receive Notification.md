(If yes to each, move on to the next scenario)
    
<br> <!-- Adding one line space -->

- **Is the Sales Connection app opened or running in the background?**<br>

  It should run in the background. Killing an app (swiping it up) will force close the app and hinder users from receiving notifications.<br><br>
  
- **Are the notifications enabled for the Sales Connection app on your phone?**<br>

  Go to Settings > Notification > Sales Connection > Turn on Allow Notifications<br>
  *Varies depending on phone model<br><br>

- **Is the Sales Connection app allowed to run in the background in your phone settings?**<br>

  Go to Settings > Battery/application manager > Sales Connection > Turn on Run in background/Auto-launch<br>
  *Varies depending on phone model<br><br>

- **Is your phone in ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù, Night or Power Saving mode?**<br>

  These modes will block notifications on your phone. Go to the Quick Settings Panel (swipe down from the top of your screen) and turn these icons off.<br><br>

- **Install and uninstall if the notification doesn‚Äôt come with the ringtone.**<br>

  This is due to the Sales Connection ringtone comes with a special tone. To reset, just install and uninstall.<br>


  Default will be the notification sound provided by the app. But if user changes/uses a different notification tone, there will be no sound.<br>
