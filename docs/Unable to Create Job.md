## ðŸ”‘ Why I unable to create jobs? 
<aside>
(If yes to each, move on to the next scenario)
    
<br> <!-- Adding one line space -->

- **Are you trying to create jobs under a customer or project?**<br>

  If *Yes*,<br><br>
  &emsp; **1. Are you assigned to the customer or project?**<br>
  &emsp; You can only create jobs under the customers and projects that you are assigned to.<br><br>
  &emsp; **2. You are assigned to the customer or project but cannot create jobs under it.**<br>
  &emsp; Request the admin to give the job creation access.<br>
     
  <br>If *No* (trying to create standalone job on schedule page),<br><br>
  &emsp; **1. The user may not have creation access for jobs.**<br>
  &emsp; Check in the admin account if the user is given job creation access.<br>
